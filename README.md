# 🏠 Snoop – [S]earch & [N]avigate [O]ffers [O]n [P]latform

**Snoop** is a modern, full-featured platform for property search, management, and analytics.  
Inspired by [Fredy](https://github.com/orangecoding/fredy), it takes real estate automation to the next level — powered by a cutting-edge tech stack, refined UI, and extended functionality.

Snoop scrapes multiple property services (Immonet, Immowelt, etc.) and sends new listings as soon as they appear.  
The list of providers is easily extendable, and a clean web UI allows you to configure and manage your search jobs effortlessly.

When matching listings are found, Snoop sends them via Slack, Email, or Telegram (more adapters can be added).  
All listings are tracked to prevent duplicates — even across platforms — while enabling analytics and insights.
